# Caesar-Cipher

A simple program designed to encrypt and decrypt text (files) with Caesar's cipher using an arbitrary key (0-25) entered by the user written in pure C. User is presented with a CLI-based menu giving him/her 3 choices:

1. Encrypt (e)
2. Decrypt (d)
3. Quit the program (q)

This program consists of three files:

1. decrypt.h
2. encrypt.h
3. main.c

To use this program simply download these three files from the root folder and compile them. Note, however, that the content of the "main-AIO" folder and the folder itself are NOT part of the program source code and as such are not needed for the program to compile or work.
